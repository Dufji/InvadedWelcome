# Welcome+
The welcome message plugin that took longer than I'd like to admit :(


### DISCLAIMER
This plugin is just a plugin I made for fun so I can learn about how plugin-making works. This plugin is also 1.8.9 ONLY.

### Features
- Reset the counter within the game instead of config only.
- You can edit the welcome message with color codes.


### Commands
```
/resetcounter - Resets the counter
/credits - Shows credits of plugin maker

Theres also a secret command but you have to find that yourself
```
